        <p>
            God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly man, Jesus the Christ.
            He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation but did not fall into sin. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins, was raised from the dead and ascended to minister in
            the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things. Amen!

            <br> He was crucified and died. <span class="verse">Luke 23:14,15</span> <br> The incarnation of God the Son is a mystery. <span class="verse">1 Tim 3:16.</span> <br> In trying to comprehend the incarnation, how the Creator of the worlds became
            a helpless babe in a manger and to wear the garb of humanity! It is well to remember <span class="verse">Deut.29:29</span>
