        <h1>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF 2: <br> THE GOD HEAD <br><br><br>
            <p>There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three co-eternal Persons. God is immortal, all powerful, all-knowing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His self-revelation.
                He is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. Hallelujah!</p>

            When people talk about the “Godhead,” they often use the term “Trinity” in reference to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The term “Trinity” is however not in the Bible. <br> The term <b>“Godhead”</b> is used three times in the Bible:
            <span class="verse">Acts 17:29
                Romans 1:20 
                Colossians 2:9</span> <br><br> There is only ONE God. <span class="verse">Deut.6:4; Isa.46:9; Exo 20:3; 
                    Mark 12:29-32; 1 Cor 8:4,5; 
                    1 Cor 8:6; Eph.4:4-6; 1 Tim 2:5</span> <br> <br> While the scriptures are clear that there is one God, there is Plurality Within the Godhead. There are Three Persons of God <span class="verse">Gen.1:26; Gen.3:22; 11:7</span> <br><br>            Various references distinguishes the Spirit of God from God. <span class="verse">Gen. 1:1-2; Isa.48:16</span>

            The Godhead consists of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, a unity of three co-eternal persons. <br> In the New Testament each of them is referred to as “God” and they all share the characteristics of God <span class="verse">1 Peter 1:17

    Acts 5:3-4</span> <br> <br>

            In the creation they were all present; <span class="verse">Gen 1:1,2; 
                John 1; 14:1-3</span> <br><br> In the creation of man “God” includes more that one person. “Us” does not include angels. We know this because man was made “in the image of God” – not in the image of angels. <span class="verse">Gen 1:26,27</span>            <br> After the fall of Adam and Eve, again, the plural pronoun “Us” is used for God. <span class="verse">Gen 3:22</span> <br> <br> In scattering the people at Babel, “The Lord” is referenced using the plural pronoun “Us.” <span class="verse">Gen 11:5-8</span>            <br><br> The prophecy of Christ’s reign <span class="verse">Psalms 110:1
                </span> <br><br>The Hebrew writer quoted this passage and emphasized the fact that the Lord was not referring to angels <span class="verse">Heb. 1:13</span>
            <br>Instead, this is about the Father and the Son <span class="verse">Heb. 1:5</span>
            <br> <br> Isaiah’s commission <span class="verse">Isaiah 6:8</span> <br>Though the concept of the “Trinity” can be seen in the Old Testament, there were not many details given as we have seen. <br> However, the New Testament reveals this concept
            more completely, providing us with additional information about the three distinct persons of God.

        <p>At the baptism of Jesus, all 3 persons of the Godhead were present. The voice from heaven was that of the Father. Distinct from Him was Jesus who was “being baptized” and the Holy Spirit who was “descending as a dove.” <span class="verse">Matt.3:16,17;</span><br>In
            the Great Commission, Jesus indicated that those who would be His disciples were to be baptized in the name of the Three persons – the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse">Matt.28:19</span> <br> Sending <span class="verse">“The Helper”</span>            to the apostles.
