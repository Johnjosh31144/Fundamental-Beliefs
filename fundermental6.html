        <h1>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF 6: <br> CREATION <br><br><br>
            <p>God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of His creative activity. He created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and rested on
                the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of the work He performed and completed during six literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call a week today. The first
                man and woman were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very good,” declaring the glory of God.</p>

            Genesis tells us the story of the 6-day creation week, followed by the first <span class="verse">Sabbath</span>. <br> God’s relational love is introduced right away as he creates a perfect world, then personally forms the first two human beings

            <span class="cha">The Creation Week</span> <br> The very first words of <span class="verse">the Bible tell us who the Creator is</span> and what He created. <br> The literal six-day creation week comes from Genesis chapters 1 and 2. God hovers
            over a “formless and empty” earth enveloped in darkness, and begins His word <span class="verse">Genesis 1:1,2
    Romans 11:36</span> <br> <br>

            <img src="images/image14.png" alt="" style="float: left; width: 30%;"> God created light by speaking it into existence. He saw the light was good and separated the light from the darkness. He named the light “day” and the darkness “night.”

            <br>
            <span class="cha">On the second day…</span> <br> God spoke and created the sky and the sea. He made an “expanse between the waters,” separating the water above the earth (the “firmament”) and water on the earth. The expanse in between He named
            the “sky.” Another evening and morning made this the second day. <span class="verse">Genesis 1:6-8</span>

            and trees. And on the plants grew fruit. Another evening and morning made the third day <span class="verse">Genesis 1:9-13</span>

            <span class="cha">On the fourth day…</span> <br> God spoke to create lights in the sky to brighten the earth and to distinguish seasons. Thus God made the sun to “rule over the day,” and the moon and stars to “rule over the night.” He saw

    aside for rest</a></span>He . He made it holy and blessed it, and commanded His living creation to rest as well. <br> Because the heavens and earth were finished, God paused. He asks us to <span><a style="color: rgb(43, 46, 194);" href="https://www.adventist.org/the-sabbath/the-sabbath-then-and-now/"> pause with Him each week,</a></span>            as a reminder that He is our Creator, and this world was given to us to live in and help take care of. We owe our very being to Him, and by spending time appreciating His creation, we honor Him and grow closer to Him. <span class="verse">Genesis 2:3; Exodus 20:8-11</span>

            The Genesis account tells us more still about how God created the universe. It was a collaboration between God the Father, <span><a style="color: rgb(43, 46, 194);" href="https://www.adventist.org/son/">Jesus the Son</a></span>, and the <span><a style="color: rgb(43, 46, 194);" href="https://www.adventist.org/holy-spirit/">Holy Spirit.</a></span>

            <span class="verse">John 1:1-3</span> <br> The Word, mentioned by John, is Jesus Himself. John identifies Jesus here as a primary participant in creation.
            <br> <br>

            <span class="cha">The Godhead created the universe by speaking it into existence </span> <br> The second verse of the Bible says the spirit of God hovered above the waters <span class="verse">Genesis 1:2</span> . So it was the Father, the
            son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit that created the universe together. There was a plan—a relationship, intent, and inclusion. <br> God also wanted humanity to be part of the creation process, and He made us as creative beings. Adam even helped
            by naming the animals <span class="verse">Genesis 2:20.</span><br> With the same care God used to create Adam and Eve, He created each of us before we were even born - <span class="verse">Jeremiah 1:5.</span> <br> The Godhead created the universe

            because God created you so. You are loving, caring, and imbued with free will because God made you so. <br> Knowing God created us in this way can help us relate to Him, give glory to Him, and love Him.

            <img src="images/image16.png" alt="" style="float: right; width: 30%;"> When God created the universe, He did so with care and forethought. The order in which God created earth and all its inhabitants shows his masterful design. <br> The genesis
            creation story supports the relationship between God and Living things From the first light all the way through to the animals, God spoke His creation into existence. Then the Godhead agreed to create humanity. God said, “let us make man in
            our image, after our likeness” - <span class="verse">Genesis 1:26</span> . He spoke His intent—but this time, the words did not make the man. God Himself gathered dust from the ground and formed man in his likeness. Then God breathed life
            into the human’s lifeless form. <br> The genesis creation story supports the relationship between God and Living things God came face-to-face with him, breathing into his body to give him life. Then God gave him a name: Adam. God created Adam
            and gave him his likeness, gave him His breath, and gave him a name - <span class="verse">Genesis 1:26</span> <br> Seeing that Adam had no mate, God created a female from Adam’s rib <span class="verse">Genesis 2:21-25</span> <br> The genesis
            creation story supports the relationship between God and Living things God blessed the man and woman. He told them to multiply and fill the earth. He told them to subdue the earth, and have dominion over it and all the living things on it
            - <span class="verse">Genesis 1:28</span> . God planted a garden in Eden for Adam and Eve, and filled it with every tree that is pleasant to see and good to eat - <span class="verse">Genesis 2:8-9</span> . God gave mankind dominion over all
            living things on the earth. <span class="verse">Genesis 1:26</span>. <br> The genesis creation story supports the relationship between God and Living things With this kind of order established, Adam and Eve were clearly distinct from the other
            animals. No other creature on earth was created in God’s image. No others were named by God. In fact, God allowed Adam to name all the other creatures, letting him be part of the holy work of creation! God even entrusted the first humans with
            the <span><a style="color: rgb(43, 46, 194);" href="https://www.adventist.org/stewardship/">stewardship</a></span> of the earth.

            masculine and feminine characteristics because God made us to fit together like the most intricate of puzzle pieces. We have a home because God created it, making sure it was good and perfect before He put us there. We have food and oxygen

            We have a job because God gave us dominion over the earth and all living things on it. You were wanted, planned, cared for, provided for, and designed with a purpose. Through Jesus Christ you have life, and that life started at the very origin
            of the earth. <br> In our daily lives today, we can live a life of gratitude toward our Savior and Creator.
