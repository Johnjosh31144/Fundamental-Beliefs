        <h1>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF 3: <br> GOD THE FATHER <br><br>
            <p>
                God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all Creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the
                Holy Spirit are also revelations of the Father. God the Father is frequently misunderstood. Many are aware of Christ’s mission to earth for the human race and of the Holy Spirit’s role within the individual, but what has the Father done
                with us? Is He a God of vengeance? The absentee landlord? Let’s study together

            The God of both Old and New Testament is same. Although the Old Testament alludes to the Persons of the Godhead, it does not distinguish among them. <span class="verse">Heb.1:1,2</span> <br> The New Testament makes it clear that Christ, God
            the Son, was the active agent in creation <span class="verse">John 1:1-3,14; 
    Col.1:16</span>
            <br>And that He was the God who led Israel out of Egypt <span class="verse">1 Cor.10:1-4; 
    Exo.3:14; John 8:58</span>
            <br>The Old Testament describes the Father as being a God of Mercy. <span class="verse">Exo.34:6,7; 
        Heb.10:26,27</span><br> But, NO sinful human being has ever seen God. <span class="verse">Exo.33:20</span>

            <span class="cha">GOD IS OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN AND WE ARE HIS CHILDREN.</span> <br> Just like human parents love their children, so God loves us. But unlike our earthly parents’ love, His love is perfect. He loves you even more than your earthly
            parents ever could! It’s incredible to think the God of the universe—the One who created all things—would call us His children. And yet, that’s what the Bible tells us! <span class="verse">1 John 3:1
</span> <br>
            <span class="cha">GOD IS A FATHER TO THE FATHERLESS.</span><br>It’s a sad reality in our sinful world that some people are without an earthly father who loves and protects them the way he should. If you have a father who has wounded your soul,
            you can rest assured your Father in Heaven will never disappoint you. God’s love is perfect and His grace and mercy never runs out. <span class="verse">Psalms 68:5; 1 John 4:18</span>

            <span class="cha">GOD IS THE FATHER OF JESUS.</span> <br> Not only is God the Father your Heavenly Father, He is also the Father of Jesus. According to the Bible, God loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus to die for us. <span class="verse">John 3:16;</span>            And we see that Jesus called God His Father, Abba, which means “father” in Aramaic. <span class="verse">Mark 14:36</span> <br>
            <span class="cha">GOD IS THE CREATOR AND SUSTAINER OF LIFE</span> <br> In the beginning God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. God formed humans in His own image, setting us apart from any other living thing on earth. It’s true we
            don’t know what God looks like. So His image is defined by who He is. He bestows some of His key attributes upon us. This means we are intelligent, conscious beings with the ability to choose our own actions and allegiances. <span class="verse">Acts 17:28; Genesis 1:27; 
    Colossians 1:16, Psalms 33:9</span>

            God the Father is a GOD OF MERCY. God demonstrated His character by His gracious acts and by the word picture He proclaimed to Moses in <span class="verae">Exo. 34:6,7;</span> <br> He asked Moses that Israel build Him a sanctuary that He may
            dwell among them. <span class="verse"> Exo.25:8</span> <br> God the Father is a PERSONAL AND LOVING GOD interested in His people’s concerns. He makes and keeps His Covenant with His children <span class="verse">Gen.9:1-17; 
    Gen.12:1-3</span> <br> God the Father is a REDEEMER GOD. As God of the Exodus, He miraculously led a nation of slaves to liberty. He will do the same for us. <span class="verse">Psalms 8:3,4; 
    Psalms 18:1,2</span> <br> God the Father is a GOD OF REFUGE. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. <span class="verse">Psalms.46:1; 27:5; 
        Psalms 125:2; 55:22; 
        Psalms 62:8; 86:15
    </span> <br> God the Father is a GOD OF FORGIVENESS. After his sins of adultery and murder, David earnestly entreated the Lord for forgiveness. <span class="verse">Psalms 51:1,11.</span> <br> He was comforted by the assurance that God is wonderfully
            merciful. <span class="verse">Psalms 103:11-1</span>

            God the Father in the New Testament – God the father of Jesus Christ – God of all creation. <span class="verse">I Cor 8:6; John 1:17;</span> <br> The Father of all Believers;
            <span class="verse">Rom.8:15,16;</span> Jesus reveals the Father; <span class="verse">John 1:18; 6:38; 14:9.</span> To know Jesus is to know the Father
            <br> A GOD WHO GIVES. We see His giving at Creation, at Bethlehem, and at Calvary. The cross reveals as nothing else can the truth about the Father. <span class="verse">John 3:16; 2 Cor.5:21. </span> <br> He is a God of love. <span class="verse">Luke 6:35,36; Rom 2:4.</span>            Three (3) parables portray God’s loving concern for lost humanity. <span class="verse">Luke 15</span> – the lost sheep, lost coin and the prodigal son. <br>

            <span class="cha"> GOD CARES FOR US</span> <br> God is attentive to our every thought, our every need, our every desire. He knows the number of hairs on our heads <span class="verse">Luke 12:7</span> , He knew us even before we were born
            <span class="verse">Jeremiah 1:5</span> . <br> He even knows what’s bothering us before we pray about it - <span class="verse">Matthew 6:8.</span> <br>He doesn’t want us to be anxious or afraid. He has promised to care for us so we can go
            through life without fear. That’s why He asks us not to worry about our lives: <span class="verse">Matthew 6:25,26; 1 Peter 5:7</span>

            <span class="cha">GOD PROTECTS US</span> <br> We live in a sinful world. When humanity made the choice in the Garden of Eden to know both good and evil, the world became as it is today. Good and evil surround us, and the consequences of our
            choices play out. But even so, God offers us His protection. He is our “refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble <span class="verse">Psalm 46:1.</span> <br> Whatever obstacles you face in your lifetime, you can be assured that God
            will never forsake you <span class="verse">Deut. 31:6 . Isaiah 41:10</span>
            <span class="cha">GOD DISCIPLINES US</span>
            <br> Just like earthly parents need to lovingly discipline their children, God also disciplines His children. It’s not something any of us enjoy. No one likes being corrected! But being disciplined is in our best interest. <span class="verse">Proverbs 3:11,12; 
    Hebrews 12:3-11
    </span>

            <span class="cha">HOW GOD RELATES WITH US, HIS CHILDREN</span> <br> God the Father desires to have a relationship with each one of us. He loves His children with an everlasting love and He wants to spend time with you. <br> Just imagine, the
            God of the universe doesn’t just want you to know about Him—He wants you to know Him!
